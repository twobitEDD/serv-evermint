### How to make your own EVM-enabled chain from this fork:
_(support Linux & MacOS only)_

Step 1: Open `constants.go` and change every constant in there.
Do `git commit` (+ `git push`) to save your changes.

Step 2: Run `./rename-chain.sh`

Done, you have your own chain now. Try running tests to make sure everything is working fine.
